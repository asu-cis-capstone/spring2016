# CIS Capstone Projects - Spring 2016 Cohort

The Spring 2016 semester features three sections totalling 88 students.  In twenty teams of 3 to 5, they are developing prototypes of new information systems technologies and businesses.  Inspired by the ideas of [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) and using a Scrum method, they will continue to develop these ideas iteratively until their final presentation on April 28th.  The 20 teams and projects (with codenames) are:
